# South-Ostrobotnia-AI
Experiments with GPT: Finetuning a Finnish GPT to South Ostrobotnia

For generation of South Ostrobotnian dialect some model adaptation material is needed.
I have crawled some texts from the following blogs: http://pohopekka.blogspot.com/, https://www.blogit.fi/tag/pakina

You can run the crawler by the shell script run_crawl.sh.
